This is a Student Information System I first built back in my 3rd semester.

Now that I'm in my 10th semester, I'm revisiting it as a personal challenge. The original code worked, but it's a perfect example of an early projectâ€”full of code smells and messy dependencies.

My goal is to refactor this entire project, applying what I've learned about good software design. I'm focusing on cleaning up the code, fixing the smells, and implementing SOLID principles to make it clean, maintainable, and much more professional.

This repo is just a live look at my journey from "making it work" to "making it right."
